# ðŸ¥° Bootstrap: Ethereum

{% hint style="success" %}
**The inaugural SFSkrill collection:** Beginning a multi-chain series of NFT collections, it only makes sense to anchor our journey to the Ethereum blockchain.
{% endhint %}

This limited release of 333 Shibe Faced NFT will launch our community and brand.

* Eligible holders gifted a corresponding NFT on successive launches (until ShibeFace DAO).
* Buy with SHIB & 40% of your purchase price is burned

### Operation: Bootstrap

The purpose to this initial Ethereum launch is jump-start our community. We have a big vision for the future, but we can't do it on our own. Lets start by proving ourselves on the small things, and take this journey one step at a time.

### **Details TBD**

**The SHIB burn is our main utility planned for the Bootstrap** sale. If our sale completes and much less than half is paid with SHIB then we can use some of the funds that would have been burnt for community development.

The bootstrap phase is mostly to get our operation up and running and to prepare us for our "[Official Launch](official-solana-or-matic.md)" (a month or so after ETH sale) where utility will take center stage.&#x20;

We have ideas and moxy enough to get through the next year, and are also eager to discover what ideas you might have.

We want to build something that will last, something that supports the community in sharing in opportunities of Web3.

**We hope to onboard many shibes to this NFT ecosystem and bankless future!**

**We can grow together and, as a community, define the future of ShibeFace DAO.**

### **Hop In!**
