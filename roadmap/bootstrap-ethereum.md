# ðŸ¥° Bootstrap: Ethereum

{% hint style="success" %}
**The inaugural SFSkrill collection:** Beginning a multi-chain series of NFT collections, it only makes sense to anchor our journey to the Ethereum blockchain.
{% endhint %}

This limited release of 333 Shibe Faced NFT will launch our community and brand.

_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**These NFT are a Master Key to this upcoming series of launches. Eligible holders will be gifted a corresponding NFT on successive launches (until the rewards hub).**</mark>_

Some of you will become valued members of our team, help to shape the future of this project, perhaps beginning your career in cryptocurrency.

#### Operation: Bootstrap

The purpose to this initial Ethereum launch is jump-start our community. We have a big vision for the future, but we can't do it on our own. Lets start by proving ourselves on the small things, and take this journey one step at a time.

### Pay with SHIB:  40% burned.

Shiba Inu token is the #1 token of Ethereum blockchain, and burning is the most popular past-time among the SHIB family.

Since we know how much SHIB community loves burning, If you buy with SHIB, instead of ETH, then 40% of your purchase price will be burned.

{% hint style="info" %}
We don't pay influencers to shill our products, but use that part of our budget to provide real utility for our holders.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Further Details TBD**

The SHIB burn is our main utility planned for the Bootstrap sale. If for some reason more people pay with ETH than SHIB, maybe you prefer to part with ETH and keep SHIB, or some people who aren't already SHIB holders will pay with ETH. \
\
If our sale completes and less than half is paid with SHIB then we can use some of those funds for community development.

The bootstrap phase is meant to prepare us for our "[Official Launch](official-solana-or-matic.md)" that will occur in the month after our ETH sale is complete.&#x20;

We have ideas and moxy enough to get through the next year. We want to create something that will last beyond our direct involvement, so the community can share in the profits and the opportunity to learn various aspects of NFT project management.&#x20;

**We hope to welcome many shibes into this NFT ecosystem and the greater crypto culture!**

As a community, together, we define the financial decisions and the future path of the DAO beginning with managing proceeds from future cross-chain NFT launches.
