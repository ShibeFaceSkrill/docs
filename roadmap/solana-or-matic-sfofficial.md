# ðŸ˜Ž Solana|Matic: sfOfficial!

* Begin work on public data-set of shiba inu faces.
* Eligible purchase of this sale win a complimentary NFT during our next NFT release.
* Help choose which chain and utilities to feature, next.&#x20;
* Prototype community DAO decision making practices.&#x20;
* Each NFT mints SKRILL tokens to HOLDers.

### **NFT as Time-Release Contract Wallets**

**One challenge many cryptocurrency traders face is holding onto tokens long enough for their value to truly appreciate.**&#x20;

**The NFT in our "official" launch will be time-released smart contract wallets, that save a portion of their purchase price, denominated in DOGE or SHIB (synthetic \ pegged depending on which chain), released to its owner in 3-5 years.**

For an NFT launch itself, I would prefer Solana to be next, but not sure which Shibe tokens are available as synthetic assets on Solana.&#x20;

Polygon, on the other hand, certainly has both Doge and Shib pegged and available for this use-case.
