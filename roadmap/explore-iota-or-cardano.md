# ðŸ¤“ Explore: Iota|Cardano

From this point, we can explore any number of blockchains, as a community.&#x20;

We will have a strong sense which direction the project will pursue in the immediate future.&#x20;

While we look forward to your contributions, we'll leave nothing to chance. [The team](../info/team.md), here, already have a few ideas that would make for an epic launch.

The core thought behind this collection would be to introduce some financially oriented games.  One idea includes NFT death match, another involves a team-building scavenger hunt.&#x20;

Don't want to spoil the mechanics behind those, but either path would be excellent.

### 3333 NFT on Cardano or IOTA

* Utility:&#x20;
  * NFT death match?
  * Team building scavenger hunt?
* Holder from this sale to receive a companion token on the following launch.
* Each NFT mints $SKRILL tokens to HOLDers.
