From this point, we can explore any number of blockchains, as a community.&#x20;

We will have a strong sense by now what direction the project should pursue in the immediate future.&#x20;

That said, we already have a few ideas that would make this an epic launch. One involves NFT battling each-other for real prizes, another could be a sort of scavenger hunt. Don't want to spoil the mechanics behind those, but it will be dope.

#### 3333 NFT : April

* Financial Utility: TBD.&#x20;
* Holder of tokens from this sale to receive a corresponding token on 1 following launch.
* Each NFT mints SKRILL tokens to HOLDers.
