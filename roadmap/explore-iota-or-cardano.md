# ðŸ¤“ Explore: Iota|Cardano

From this point, we can explore any number of blockchains, as a community.&#x20;

We will have a strong sense which direction the project will pursue in the immediate future.&#x20;

While we look forward to your contributions, we'll leave nothing to chance. [The team](../info/team.md), here, already have a few ideas that would make for an epic launch.

One idea includes NFT death match, another involves a team-building scavenger hunt.&#x20;

Don't want to spoil the mechanics behind those, but either path would be excellent, and that's just our initial brainstorming.

#### 3333 NFT : April

* Financial Utility: TBD.&#x20;
  * NFT death match
  * Team building scavenger hunt
* Holder from this sale to receive a companion token on the following launch.
* Each NFT mints SKRILL tokens to HOLDers.
