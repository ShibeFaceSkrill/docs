# ðŸ¤  ShibeFaceDAO & Beyond!

By this point in the journey, we hope to be seriously working towards ShibeFaceDAO.

The idea being that, in the beginning, the core team make most decisions and have most responsibilities, while giving the community room to guide its flow. Across a series of NFT Drops, gradually distribute responsibilities of operations from its centralized inception. &#x20;

There are a few other chains we'd like to launch NFT on before creating a cross-chain community accelerator. That could include a total of 4-6 NFT collections before going full-DAO.

Before reaching that point, we will have demonstrated a variety of DeFi use-cases integrated with NFTs and have created a play-book of patterns for future launches. &#x20;

### Lets take NFT launches to the next level

Have we seen enough 10k PFP collections that try to strap utility on as an after-thought?&#x20;
