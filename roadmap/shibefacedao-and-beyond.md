# ðŸ¤  ShibeFaceDAO and Beyond!

We hope to be seriously working towards the DAO after the Cruizin' launch.

The idea being that in the beginning, the team makes most of the decisions, while still giving the community plenty opportunity to guide the flow.

There are a few other chains we'd like to launch NFT on before creating the cross-chain rewards hub. That could include somewhere between 6-9 NFT drops while transitioning to the DAO and launching the cross-chain DeFi hub community accelerator.

Before crossing that check-point, we will have demonstrated a variety of DeFi use-cases integrated to NFTs. \
\
**Lets take NFT launches to the next level.**&#x20;

Have we seen enough 10k PFP collections that try to strap utility on as an after-thought?&#x20;
