## Skrill Genesis: Community Launch

{% hint style="success" %}
**The inaugural launch of SFSkrill:** Beginning a multi-chain series of NFT collections, it only make sense to anchor this venture to the Ethereum blockchain
{% endhint %}

This limited release of 333 Shibe Faced NFT will launch our community and brand on the Ethereum blockchain.

_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**These NFT are a Master Key to this upcoming series of launches. Holders of these NFT will be airdropped a corresponding NFT on successive launches (until the rewards hub).**</mark>_

Many of you will become valued members of our team, and help to shape the future of this project. The core theme to this launch is to build community and rewarding our earliest and most active community members.&#x20;

### Pay with SHIB  40% burned.

This is just a small launch, so it won't mean much to SHIB market, but as a sign of respect and appreciation for Ethereum community, we are burning 50% of any purchase made using Shiba Inu Token.

{% hint style="info" %}
We don't pay influencers to shill our products, but use that budget to provide utility to our users.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Hop In!**
