# ðŸ¥° Ethereum: Bootstrap

{% hint style="success" %}
**The inaugural SFSkrill collection:** Beginning a multi-chain series of NFT collections, it only makes sense to anchor our journey to the Ethereum blockchain.
{% endhint %}

This limited release of 333 Shibe Faced NFT will launch our community and brand.

_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**These NFT are a Master Key to this upcoming series of launches. Eligible holders will be gifted a corresponding NFT on successive launches (until the rewards hub).**</mark>_

Some of you will become valued members of our team, help to shape the future of this project, perhaps beginning your career in cryptocurrency.

#### Operation: Bootstrap

The purpose to this initial Ethereum launch is jump-start our community. We have a big vision for the future, but we can't do it on our own. Lets start by proving ourselves on the small things, and take this journey one step at a time.

### Pay with SHIB:  40% burned.

Shiba Inu token is the #1 token of Ethereum blockchain, and burning is the most popular past-time among the SHIB family.

Since we know how much SHIB community loves burning, If you buy with SHIB, instead of ETH, then 40% of your purchase price will be burned.

{% hint style="info" %}
We don't pay influencers to shill our products, but use that part of our budget to provide real utility for our holders.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Further Details TBD**

Besides the SHIB burn there is no major utility planned for this launch. We will figure out the best ways to reward our early community members, and there is still room for innovation.&#x20;

The bootstrap phase is meant to prepare us for our "[Official Launch](matic-or-solana-official.md)", starting immediately after the ETH sale is complete. We will decide as a community further details of upcoming launches while preparing for Bootstrap.
