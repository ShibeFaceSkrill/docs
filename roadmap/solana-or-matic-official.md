### **NFT as Time-Release Contract Wallets**

**One challenge many cryptocurrency traders face is holding onto tokens long enough for their value to truly appreciate.**&#x20;

**The NFT in our "official" launch will be time-released smart contract wallets, that save a portion of their purchase price, denominated in DOGE or SHIB (pegged assets dependent on which chain), released to its holder in 5 years.. (exact time to lock decided by ETH sale participants).**

For an NFT launch itself, I would prefer Solana to be next, but not sure which Shibe tokens are available as synthetic assets on Solana.&#x20;

Polygon, on the other hand, probably has both Doge and Shib pegged and available for this use-case.
