# ðŸ˜Ž Official: Solana|Matic

* Begin work on public data-set of shiba inu faces.
* Eligible purchases from this sale gifted a companion NFT from the next NFT collection.
* Each NFT mints SKRILL tokens to HOLDers.
* Help choose which chain and utilities to feature, next.&#x20;
* Prototype community DAO decision making practices.&#x20;

### **NFT as Time-Release Contract Wallets**

**One challenge many cryptocurrency traders face is holding onto tokens long enough for their value to truly appreciate.**&#x20;

**The NFT in our "official" launch will be time-released smart contract wallets, that save a portion of their purchase price, denominated in DOGE or SHIB (synthetic \ pegged depending on which chain), released to its owner in 3-5 years.**

For an NFT launch itself, I would prefer Solana to be next, but not sure if both $SHIB and $DOGE are available as synthetic assets on Solana to satisfy this use-case.

Polygon, is more established, reliable, and certainly has both $DOGE and $SHIB pegged and available for this use-case.
