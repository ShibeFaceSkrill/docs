### **999 NFT as Time-Release Contract Wallets**

**One challenge many cryptocurrency traders face is holding onto tokens long enough for their value to truly appreciate.**&#x20;

**The NFT in our "official" launch will control time-released smart contract wallets, that save a portion of their purchase price, denominated in $DOGE or $SHIB, (synthetic \ pegged) released to its owner in 3-5 years.**

In general, I would prefer Solana to be next, since it seems to hold the most authority among enthusiasts, but not sure if both $SHIB and $DOGE are currently available as synthetic assets on Solana to satisfy this use-case.

Polygon, is more established, reliable, and certainly has both coins pegged and available for this use-case
