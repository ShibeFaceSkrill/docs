# ðŸ¤  Delta and Beyond!

At the moment, we plan to launch a line of NFT on at least 3 additional chains before creating the cross-chain rewards hub. That would involve a total of 6-9 launches before transforming this whole project into a community run DAO and launching a cross-chain gallery and rewards hub.

Before crossing that check-point, we will have demonstrated a variety of DeFi use-cases integrated into your NFT. \
\
We are bringing NFT launches into the future. Have we seen enough 10k PFP collections that try to strap utility on as an after-thought? \
\
Join us and help to shape the future of NFT launches.

### Moving Forward

* Create a public\open-source dataset of Shiba Inu faces, so anyone can train neural networks to create artificial images based upon them
* Create a DeFiNFT launch strategy playbook.&#x20;
* Onboard community members, gradually, from consumers \ end-users, to NFT artists, community managers, social media managers, and meme-masters; learning all the skills needed to launch your own NFT projects.
* Launch a ShibeFace Dao whos purpose is to continue launching NFT and discovering DeFi use-cases, as part of this brand and community, managing all funds from future ShibeFace NFT sales.
* ShibeFace DAO NFT Launches will fund the continued operation of the cross-chain rewards hub.
