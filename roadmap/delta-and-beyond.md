# ðŸ¤  Delta and Beyond!

At the moment, we plan to launch a line of NFT on at least 3 additional chains before creating the cross-chain rewards hub.

Before crossing that check-point, we will have demonstrated a variety of DeFi use-cases integrated into your NFT. \
\
We are bringing NFT launches into the future. Have we seen enough 10k PFP collections that try to strap on utility as an after-thought? \
\
Join us and help to shape the future of NFT launches.

### First year plans

* Launch a Shibe Dao whos purpose is to continue launching NFT and discovering DeFi use-cases, as part of this brand and community.
* Create a public\open-source dataset of Shiba Inu faces, so anyone can train neural networks to create artificial images based upon them
* Begin creating a solid playbook for NFT launches including a variety of financial use-cases and launch strategies.&#x20;
