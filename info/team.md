### Back Story &#x20;

FACED and 0xJPEG met during the great DeFi awakening of 2021. We had great fun (and pain) learning the wonders of this brand new multi-chain ecosystem growing rapidly all around us.

When I (FACED) conceived of creating an NFT collection, I didn't tell _anyone_ else what I was working on, but knew I had to bring 0xJPEG along for the ride.

We believe in the future of both $DOGE and $SHIB, But you may notice that FACED is more connected with the Dogecoin community, and 0xJPEG is more aligned with $SHIB.

### FACED - Founder and Bootstrap Technician

Found Bitcoin in 2016, and got caught in the mania of 2017. I've since learned everything I could about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. &#x20;

Then I picked up some web-dev skills, and eventually hopped onto the DeFi bandwagon 2021. Later, I had the opportunity to help launch (and sell out) a 10k PFP NFT.&#x20;

It was a ton of fun and am happy for the chance to test my own ideas in the market. I love the challenges and opportunity found in permissionless innovation, Ethereum and beyond!

I've personally obsessed over every detail in creating artificial Shibes and launching these NFT, including:

* Dataset gathering, cleaning, prep. (collect shibe pictures ü•∞)
* Training stylegan networks. (share shibe collection with AI)
* Learn to read Solidity, React, Typescript (React <3 Web3).
* Use web3 tool-chains to compile, deploy and test smart-contracts + their websites.
* Deploy smart contracts to test net and mint NFT. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

_**I love to learn and to share knowledge with people who will act on it.**_&#x20;

### 0xJPEG - Market Research & JPEG Analyst

I started my crypto journey in 2020 by watching some of the worst shills on YouTube and eventually made my way into DeFi in early 2021.

A keen observer of the market from DeFi to NFT. I have survived numerous rug-pulls: from blatant scams, to "slow rug", as well as legitimate exploits inflicted upon some of the projects I trusted my hard-earned money into.&#x20;

Spent way too much time (even during my fiat-mining duties) browsing Twitter and numerous discord channels seeking alpha, with the sole goal of becoming a meaningful contributor and builder in the Cryptoverse.

_**I believe the launch-team and community who sticks together will outlast vaporware and hype.**_&#x20;

#### **Let's build!**

### Adebimpe Omolaso **- User Experience and Design**

![Is that a treat for me?](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

To me, design is a way of crafting new worlds where everyone gets to be who they really want to be deep within. I collaborate with teams or colleagues and users to design and develop products from ground up keeping in mind the final goal and strategy of the client's business. In my work, I do my best to meet my clients' expectations and deadlines while focusing on user-centric design philosophy.

**I feel a sense of deep satisfaction when user needs and business goals align.**&#x20;
