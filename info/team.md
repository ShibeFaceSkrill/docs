### ShibeFace - Founder and Bootstrap Technician

I'm a BBS era cyberpunk. Found crypto in 2016, and caught in the mania of 2017. From there, I learned everything I could about bitcoin and and cryptocurrency.

During the down-turn, I learned some coding and web skills. When the bulls came back and DeFi was popping off, 2021, I hopped along for that wild ride, back in the game full-time.&#x20;

After DeFi slowed down, I had the opportunity to help launch (and sell out) a 10k PFP NFT. With that experience, I realized I had almost all the pieces necessary to run my own project.&#x20;

I've had the opportunity to help launch many other NFT, since, but I'm ready to bring my own ideas to the market.

I don't know everything, but love to learn and get my hands dirty, every stage of the journey. I've personally obsessed over every detail of creating artificial Shibes and launching NFT:

* Dataset gathering, cleaning, prep.
* Training stylegan networks.
* Learn to read React (Web3 <3 React).
* Learn to read solidity and use web3 tool-chains.
* hire smart contract developer
* Deploy smart contracts to test net.

I've got the drive and the determination. I never give up, and know there's lots of twists and turns before you cross the finish-line.
