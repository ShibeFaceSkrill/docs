### ShibeFace - Founder and Bootstrap Technician

![I like running fast in the snow!](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

BBS-era cyberpunk that found crypto in 2016, and got caught in the mania of 2017. Then I learned everything I could about bitcoin and and cryptocurrency.

During the down-turn, I learned some coding and web skills. When the bulls came back and DeFi was popping off, I hopped along for that wild ride, back in the game full-time.&#x20;

After DeFi slowed down, I had the opportunity to help launch (and sell out) a 10k PFP NFT.&#x20;

I realized I had almost all the pieces necessary to launch my own project.&#x20;

I've since been offered to help launch many other NFT, but think NFT needs some more creativity, and have my own ideas.&#x20;

I love the opportunity in permissionless innovation, Ethereum and beyond!

I don't know everything, but love to learn. I get my hands dirty at every stage of the journey, and have personally obsessed over every detail in creating artificial Shibes and launching these NFT, including:

* Dataset gathering, cleaning, prep. (collect shibe pictures ü•∞)
* Training stylegan networks. (share shibe collection with AI)
* Learn to read Solidity and React (Web3 <3 React).
* How to use web3 tool-chains for developing smart-contracts and their websites.
* Deploy smart contracts to test net and mint NFT. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

I can't actually **do** all of the things, but at least know how they should work.

I've got the drive and the determination. _**I never give up**_, and know there's always plenty of twists & turns before I get to the finish-line.

### 0xJPEG - Market Research & JPEG Analyst

![I sniffed something!](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1).png>)

I started my crypto journey in 2020 by watching some of the worst shills on YouTube and eventually made my way into DeFi in early 2021.

A keen observer of the market from DeFi to NFT. I have survived numerous rug-pulls: from blatant scams, to "slow rug", as well as legitimate exploits inflicted upon some of the projects I trusted my hard-earned money into.&#x20;

Spent way too much time (even during my fiat-mining duties) browsing Twitter and numerous discord channels seeking alpha, with the sole goal of becoming a meaningful contributor and builder in the Cryptoverse.

I wholeheartedly believe that a launch-team and community who sticks together and builds will outlast the vaporware and hype.&#x20;

#### **Let's build!**
