### ShibeFace - Founder and Bootstrap Technician

I'm a BBS-era cyberpunk. Found crypto in 2016, got caught in the mania of 2017, from there, I learned everything I could about bitcoin and and cryptocurrency.

During the down-turn, I learned some coding and web skills. When the bulls came back and DeFi was popping off, I hopped along for that wild ride, back in the game full-time.&#x20;

After DeFi slowed down, I had the opportunity to help launch (and sell out) a 10k PFP NFT. With that experience, I realized I had almost all the pieces necessary to run my own project.&#x20;

I've since had the opportunity to help launch many other NFT, but I'm ready to bring my own ideas to the market.

I don't know everything, but love to learn and get my hands dirty, every stage of the journey. I've personally obsessed over every detail of creating artificial Shibes and launching NFT:

* Dataset gathering, cleaning, prep.
* Training stylegan networks.
* Learn to read React (Web3 <3 React).
* Learn to read solidity and use web3 tool-chains.
* Deploy smart contracts to test net.

I've got the drive and the determination. I never give up, and know there's lots of twists and turns before you cross the finish-line.

### 0xJPEG - Market Research & JPEG Analyst

![I sniffed something!](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

I started my crypto journey in 2020 by watching some of the worst shills on YouTube and eventually made my way into DeFi in early 2021.

A keen observer of the market from DeFi to NFT. I have survived numerous rug-pulls: from blatant scams, to "slow rug", as well as legitimate exploits inflicted upon some of the projects I trusted my hard-earned money into.&#x20;

Spent way too much time (even during my fiat-mining duties) browsing Twitter and numerous discord channels seeking alpha in the market that's flooded with shameless shills and outright scammers - with the sole goal of becoming a meaningful contributor and builder in the Cryptoverse.

I wholeheartedly believe that the community that sticks and build together will outlast those hyping vaporware. Let's build!
