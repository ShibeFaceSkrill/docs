### Back Story &#x20;

ShibeFace and 0xJPEG met during the great DeFi awakening of 2021. We had great fun (and pain) learning the wonders of this brand new multi-chain ecosystem growing rapidly all around.

When I (ShibeFace) conceived of creating an NFT collection, I didn't tell _anyone_ what I was working on, but knew I had to bring 0xJPEG along for the ride.

While we believe in the future DOGE and SHIB, both, _my heart_ is with the Dogecoin community, while 0xJPEG is more closely aligned with the Shib Army.

### ShibeFace - Founder and Bootstrap Technician

BBS-era cyberpunk that found crypto in 2016, and got caught in the mania of 2017.  Since then, I've learned everything I could about bitcoin and and cryptocurrency.

Since then, I picked up some web-dev skills, and eventually hopped onto the DeFi bandwagon 2021. Later, I had the opportunity to help launch (and sell out) a 10k PFP NFT, and realized I had most of the skills necessary to launch my own.&#x20;

I've had other opportunities, but think NFT drops could use a creative touch, and am happy to throw my hat into the ring. I love the opportunity in permissionless innovation, Ethereum and beyond!

I've personally obsessed over every detail in creating artificial Shibes and launching these NFT, including:

* Dataset gathering, cleaning, prep. (collect shibe pictures ü•∞)
* Training stylegan networks. (share shibe collection with AI)
* Learn to read Solidity, React, Typescript (React <3 Web3).
* Use web3 tool-chains to compile, deploy and test smart-contracts + their websites.
* Deploy smart contracts to test net and mint NFT. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

_**I love to learn and to share knowledge with people who will act on it.**_&#x20;

### 0xJPEG - Market Research & JPEG Analyst

![I sniffed something!](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1).png>)

I started my crypto journey in 2020 by watching some of the worst shills on YouTube and eventually made my way into DeFi in early 2021.

A keen observer of the market from DeFi to NFT. I have survived numerous rug-pulls: from blatant scams, to "slow rug", as well as legitimate exploits inflicted upon some of the projects I trusted my hard-earned money into.&#x20;

Spent way too much time (even during my fiat-mining duties) browsing Twitter and numerous discord channels seeking alpha, with the sole goal of becoming a meaningful contributor and builder in the Cryptoverse.

_**I believe the launch-team and community who sticks together will outlast vaporware and hype.**_&#x20;

### **Let's build!**
