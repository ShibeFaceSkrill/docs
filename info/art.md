# ðŸŽ¨ Art

That was our first time making artificial images with stylegan. We learned a lot about data collection, how to source images, cleaning the datasets and  under which constraints would the models learn to produce the best quality shibe faces.

We made enough quality shibe faces for the Genesis Bootstrap, but wanted something a little "extra" to spruce them up.

For that little "extra", we used style transfer to plate the faces gold and exotic. &#x20;

With a little more elbow-grease, combining some of our styles with coin parts, we've got something that looks both artistic, and like an actual coin! ðŸ‘€

### The Future

We love the idea of making lots more images that look like actual coins with actual faces of Shiba Inu. All the same, future launches of ShibeFace NFT won't be restricted by style or form.&#x20;

We hope to attract many different type of artists and creatives into our fold.&#x20;

The future of ShibeFace NFT could be in your hands!
