# ü™ô Memetics

### First came DOGE

_The original memecoin._

These iconic pictures were [originally published](https://kabosu112.exblog.jp/9944144/) on February 13th, 2010. It wouldn't take long before they became the face to a multitude of wholesome [memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge) detailing the situations and many reasons why our favorite Shiba Inu is so excited.

[Dogecoin](https://dogecoin.com), originally launched "as a joke," came as a lighthearted alternative to the all too serious Bitcoin culture.

Bitcoiners focus on the technical, economic, and _political_ imperatives driving creation of a decentralized digital currency and payments network.

Dogecoin offers the same technological features as bitcoin, but with a friendly community who sustain each-other thru the highs and the lows, rallying around memes with of the most iconic breed, [Shiba Inu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba\_Inu).

### Then came SHIB

SHIB üêï LEASH ü™¢ BONE ü¶¥

Ethereum and its virtual machine have become the most potent meme in tech. It's no surprise that Ethereum would spawn its own infectious [Shiba Inu coin](https://shibatoken.com).

Shib is Ethereum's answer to Dogecoin. Same meme-worthy dog, but programmable with smart-contracts! Originally Shib was branded as "the dogecoin killer", a joke on the many tokens that branded themselves as Ethereum killers.

SHIB saw 49,000,000% gains in 2021. It's the #1 token among Ethereum whales, and continues to see a massive growth in holder addresses.

Shib is only growing stronger during the recent consolidation, and we can say confidently it's here to stay as a leading shibe token.

The [v2 Woofpaper](https://github.com/shytoshikusama/woofwoofpaper/raw/main/SHIBA\_INU\_WOOF\_WOOF.pdf) no longer contains any reference to 'killing' dogecoin, but the diehards want nothing to do with DOGE, and there is definitely a sense of rivalry.

Today, the Shiba Inu token's narrative is driven around its spirited community, massive token burns, accumulation by ETH whales, and an ecosystem of utility being created around the tokens [SHIB](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu), [LEASH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/doge-killer), [BONE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap), and the [Shiboshi](https://shiboshis.shibaswap.com/#/) NFT.

### _and then, and then, and then!_

_the most relatable of cryptocurrencies!_

We may never know exactly why, but this adorable face will forever be known as a symbol of good-fortune and prosperity.

Many other Shiba Inu related coins arise every day. Most of these immediately dump, but a few have sticking power.

**What's certain is that DOGE and SHIB are here to stay!**

### Fun, Utilities and GAINZ!

**We're here for the fun and the utilities!**

One thing cryptocurrencies have proven is that _Fun_ and _Finance_ go hand-in-hand. That's why we're bringing the best that DeFi has to offer with NFT and timeless memetics.

### I'm putting it all in Dog Money!
