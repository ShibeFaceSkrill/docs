### **A Dog-Lover's Best Friend**

ShibeFaceSkrill will involve a series of NFT drops on different blockchains, exploring financial use-cases, communities and tech-stacks.

That exploration will culminate in the creation of ShibeFaceDao, cross-chain DeFi hub, and gamified NFT ecosystem.

Each launch will feature a unique financial use-case.

### What's different about ShibeFaceSkrill?

Besides everything? :joy:

NFT launches **** commonly involve massive marketing budgets that include big payouts and giveaways to influencers.

In theory, influencers are needed to get seen by a lot of eyes, and build the necessary hype.&#x20;

In practice, these influencers are rarely friends to the community or the project's success.

We think shifting a significant portion of the budget from paying influencers to providing real value for our community could make a revolutionary shift for NFT launches.&#x20;

W_e need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. ...
