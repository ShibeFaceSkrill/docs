### **A Dog-Lover's Best Friend**

ShibeFaceSkrill will involve a series of NFT drops on different blockchains, exploring financial use-cases, communities and tech-stacks.

That exploration will culminate in the creation of ShibeFaceDao, cross-chain DeFi hub, and gamified NFT ecosystem.

Each launch will feature a unique financial use-case.

### What's different about ShibeFaceSkrill?

#### Besides everything? :joy:

* We like realistic coins with realistic faces of our very favorite Shiba Inu.&#x20;
* We like artists and memesters native to the Shiba_verse_
* We like creative approach to NFT launch design and utility
* We prioritize community over influencers &#x20;

**NFT launches commonly involve big payouts to influencers.**&#x20;

_In theory_, influencers are needed to get seen by a lot of eyes, and attract necessary attention.

_In practice_, NFT influencers are rarely friends to the community or a project's success.

> _**Our focus in on community, NOT HYPE.**_**  -ShibeFace**

Instead, we've designed the structure of our launches to foster grass-roots growth, so that each launch builds to the next, and to the extent that we are successful, the community can eventually take ownership of that success, with the eventual launch of ShibeFaceDAO.&#x20;

### How Memesis, Such Token

W_e need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. ... I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme._ [**Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Selfish\_Gene)
