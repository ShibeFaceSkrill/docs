### **A Dog-Lover's Best Friend**

Shibe Face Skrill will involve a series of small drops on various chains, exploring financial use-cases, blockchain communities and tech-stacks.

After exploring a different chains, the team together with the community will choose one to be a hub and create a cross-chain yield farm and NFT game-fi ecosystem.

{% hint style="success" %}
Each line of **ShibeFace NFT** we release will feature a unique financial use-case.
{% endhint %}

NFT launches **** commonly involve massive marketing budgets including big payouts and giveaways to influencers who are meant to use their reach to create hype around the NFT line.&#x20;

In theory, those influencers are needed to get the project seen by a lot of eyes. We're betting on the community, and shifting that portion of the budget to its development.

### Roadmap: Jump right in

Our first launch is coming soon on Ethereum.&#x20;

We have many of our own plans and creative ideas for Shibe Faced NFT, but we're also looking forward to your input!&#x20;

The participants of our Genesis launch will help to decide which chains and which utilities to bring for future launches.

W_e need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. ... I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme._ [**Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Selfish\_Gene)
