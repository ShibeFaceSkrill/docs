### **A Dog-Lover's Best Friend**

ShibeFaceSkrill will involve a series of micro-drops on different blockchains, exploring financial use-cases, communities and tech-stacks.

That exploration will culminate in the creation of a cross-chain cultural center and game-fi ecosystem.

Each launch will feature a unique financial use-case.

### What's different about ShibeFace?

Besides everything?

NFT launches **** commonly involve massive marketing budgets including big payouts and giveaways to influencers.

In theory, influencers are needed to get seen by a lot of eyes, and build the necessary hype. In practice, these influencers are rarely friends to the community.

We think shifting a significant portion of the budget from paying influencers to providing real value for our community will be a revolutionary shift for NFT launches.

### Roadmap: Jump right in

Our initial NFT Drop is coming soon to Ethereum.&#x20;

We have many of our own plans and creative ideas for Shibe Faced NFT, but we're also looking forward to your input!&#x20;
