### So Artefishul ðŸ‘¾ Much Shibe!

ShibeFaceSkrill is dropping a series of NFT collections on different blockchains, exploring financial use-cases, communities and tech-stacks.

Our journey will culminate in the creation of ShibeFaceDao, a cross-chain DeFi hub, and gamified NFT ecosystem.

Each launch will feature a unique financial use-case.

### What's different about ShibeFaceSkrill?

#### ![](.gitbook/assets/wazatoz-doge.gif)

#### Besides everything? :joy:

* We like coins with realistic faces of our very favorite Shiba Inu.&#x20;
* We love artists and memesters native to the Shiba_verse._
* We make a creative approach to NFT launch design and utility.
* We prioritize community over influencers.

**NFT launches commonly involve big payouts to influencers.**&#x20;

_In theory_, influencers are needed to gain visibility, and attract necessary attention.

_In practice_, NFT influencers are rarely friends to the community or a project's success.

> _**We're focused on dank memes and our community, NOT HYPE.**_**  -ShibeFace**

We've structured this series of launches to prioritize organic growth, so that the holders of each collection have something to look forward and build towards.&#x20;

Starting small and building up to bigger collections also allows the team to gain trust over time.&#x20;

To the extent that we are successful, our shibes can grow into that success along with the team, taking ownership over the brand through participation in ShibeFaceDAO.
