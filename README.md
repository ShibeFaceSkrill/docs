Not Your Granddad's NFT Collection

### Such Faces!

ShibeFaceSkrill is dropping a series of NFT collections on different blockchains, exploring use-cases, communities and tech-stacks.

Our journey will culminate in the creation of ShibeFaceDao, a cross-chain DeFi hub, and gamified NFT ecosystem.

### How are we different?

* We like tokens with realistic faces of our very favorite Shiba Inu ❤️
* We love artists and memesters native to the Shiba-verse
* We take a creative approach to NFT launch design and utility
* We prioritize organic growth and delivering genuine value

**NFT launches commonly involve big payouts to influencers.**

_In theory_, influencers are needed to gain visibility, and attract necessary attention.

_In practice_, NFT influencers are rarely friends to the community or a project's success.

We've structured this series of launches to prioritize organic growth, so that the holders of each collection have something to look forward to and build towards.

Starting small and building up to bigger collections also allows the team to gain trust over time.

**To the extent that we are successful**, **our shibes can grow** with that success, **taking ownership** over the brand **through participation in ShibeFaceDAO**.
