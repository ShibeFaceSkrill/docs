### **A Dog-Lover's Best Friend**

ShibeFaceSkrill will involve a series of micro-drops on different blockchains, exploring financial use-cases, communities and tech-stacks.

That exploration will culminate in the creation of a cross-chain NFT rewards hub and game-fi ecosystem.

{% hint style="success" %}
Each launch will feature a unique financial use-case.
{% endhint %}

### How will we pay for that?

NFT launches **** commonly involve massive marketing budgets including big payouts and giveaways to influencers.

In theory, influencers are needed to get seen by a lot of eyes, and build the necessary hype. In practice, these influencers are rarely friends to the community.

We think shifting that portion of the budget towards providing real financial utility to our holders could be a revolutionary shift for NFT.

### Roadmap: Jump right in

Our initial NFT Drop is coming soon to Ethereum.&#x20;

We have many of our own plans and creative ideas for Shibe Faced NFT, but we're also looking forward to your input!&#x20;

#### The participants of our Genesis launch will help to decide on which chains to launch next and which utilities to prioritize.

### Memetics

W_e need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. ... I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme._ [**Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Selfish\_Gene)
