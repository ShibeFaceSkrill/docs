# üí∞ Then came SHIB

Ethereum and its virtual machine have become the most potent meme in tech. It's no surprise that Ethereum would spawn its own infectious [Shiba Inu coin](https://shibatoken.com).

Shib is Ethereum's answer to Dogecoin. Same meme-worthy dog, but programmable with smart-contracts! Originally Shib was branded as "the dogecoin killer", a joke on the many tokens that branded themselves as Ethereum killers.

SHIB saw 49,000,000% gains in 2021. It's the #1 token among Ethereum whales, and continues to see a massive growth in holder addresses.

Shib is only growing stronger during the recent consolidation, and we can say confidently it's here to stay as a leading shibe token.

The [v2 Woofpaper](https://github.com/shytoshikusama/woofwoofpaper/raw/main/SHIBA\_INU\_WOOF\_WOOF.pdf) **** no longer contains any reference to 'killing' dogecoin, but the diehards want nothing to do with DOGE, and there is definitely a sense of rivalry.&#x20;

Today, the Shiba Inu token's narrative is driven around its spirited community, massive token burns, accumulation by ETH whales, and an ecosystem of utility being created around the tokens [SHIB](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu), [LEASH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/doge-killer), [BONE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap), and the [Shiboshi](https://shiboshis.shibaswap.com/#/) NFT.
