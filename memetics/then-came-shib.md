# 💰 Then came SHIB

Ethereum and its virtual machine have become the most potent meme in cryptocurrency, it's no surprise then that Ethereum would spawn its own infectious Shiba Inu coin.

Shib is Ethereum's answer to Dogecoin. Originally branded as "the dogecoin killer", as a joke on the many tokens that have branded themselves as Ethereum killers.

SHIB saw 49,000,000% gains in 2021. It's the #1 token among Ethereum whales, and continues to see a massive growth in holder addresses.

Shib is only growing stronger during the recent consolidation, and we can say confidently it's here to stay as a leading shibe token.

The [**v2 Woofpaper**](https://github.com/shytoshikusama/woofwoofpaper/raw/main/SHIBA\_INU\_WOOF\_WOOF.pdf) **** no longer contains any reference to 'killing' dogecoin, but the tokens DOGE and SHIB seem inexorably twined.&#x20;

Today, the Shiba Inu token's narrative is driven around its spirited community, massive token burns, massive accumulation by ETH whales, and an ecosystem of utility being created around the tokens SHIB, LEASH and BONE.

What it means for us launching NFT, on Ethereum chain, where NFT culture has blossomed and burst into the mainstream, it's only right to heavily feature SHIB in our Roadmap.
