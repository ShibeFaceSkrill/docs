# 💰 Then came SHIB

Ethereum and its virtual machine have become the most potent meme in cryptocurrency, it's no surprise then that Ethereum would spawn its own infectious ShibaInu coin.

Shib is Ethereum's answer to Dogecoin. Originally branded as "the dogecoin killer", as a joke on the many tokens that have branded themselves as Ethereum killers.

SHIB saw 49,000,000% gains in 2021. It's the #1 token among Ethereum whales, and continues to see a massive growth in holder addresses.

Shib is only growing stronger during the recent consolidation, and we can say confidently it's here to stay as a leading shibe token.

The [**v2 Woofpaper**](https://github.com/shytoshikusama/woofwoofpaper/raw/main/SHIBA\_INU\_WOOF\_WOOF.pdf) **** no longer contains any reference to 'killing' dogecoin. Now, the narrative is driven around massive token burns, massive accumulation by ETH whales, and an ecosystem of utility being created around the tokens SHIB, LEASH and BONE.

That's a massive advantage SHIB has over DOGE: the ability to use SHIB in smart-contracts as is native to its Ethereal home.&#x20;

What it means for us is that by launching our NFT on Ethereum chain, the leading NFT platform, it's only right to heavily feature SHIB in our ShibeFace Roadmap.
