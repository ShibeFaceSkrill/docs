# ü™ô First came DOGE

These iconic pictures were [originally published](https://kabosu112.exblog.jp/9944144/) on February 13th, 2010. It wouldn't take long before they became the face to a multitude of wholesome memes detailing the situations and many reasons why our favorite doge is so excited.

Dogecoin, launched originally "as a joke," came as a lighthearted alternative to the all too serious Bitcoin culture.&#x20;

Bitcoiners focus on the technical, economic, and _political_ imperatives driving creation of a decentralized digital currency.&#x20;

Dogecoin offers the same technological features as bitcoin, but with a friendly community who rally around images of the most meme-worthy dog, of the most iconic breed, [**Shiba Inu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba\_Inu).

### Dogecoiners have the most fun!

Not meaning offence. If it helps, consider it a challenge, but it's hard to argue.&#x20;

#### Dogecoin knows how to have FUN!
