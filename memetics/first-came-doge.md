# ü™ô First came DOGE

These iconic pictures were [originally published](https://kabosu112.exblog.jp/9944144/) on February 13th, 2010. It wouldn't take long before they became the face to a multitude of wholesome memes detailing the situations and many reasons why our favorite Shiba Inu is so excited.

Dogecoin launched, in 2011, using the most memeworthy dog as its mascot. Originally launched "as a joke," Dogecoin came as a lighthearted alternative to the all too serious Bitcoin culture.&#x20;

Bitcoiners focus on the technical, economic, and _political_ imperatives driving creation of a decentralized digital currency.&#x20;

Dogecoin offers the same technological features as bitcoin, but with a friendly community who sustain eachother thru the highs and the lows, rallying around memes made with images of the most iconic breed, on the internet, [**Shiba Inu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba\_Inu).

### Dogecoiners have the most fun!

Not meaning any offence. If it helps, consider it a challenge, but it's hard to argue.&#x20;

#### Dogecoin knows how to have FUN!
